The app is available at (please be patient, the pod is in sleeping mode when you start it, therefore the first time you visit the link below it will take about 15-20 seconds to load.)

After authentication(base authentication) the users will be shown different views
Also different quesries will be executed to order the columns beings shown

The ADMIN user is able to create, update, delete books
The normal user is only able to read
